# Code Gym 2025 Hackathon: 3rd Place Finish

This repository showcases the solutions that secured a 3rd place finish at the Code Gym 2025 hackathon. This project is a testament to my ability to solve complex problems under pressure and write efficient code in a competitive environment.

## About the Hackathon

The Code Gym 2025 was an intense 24-hour coding competition where participants were challenged with a series of algorithmic problems. My solutions were written in C++ and Python, demonstrating my versatility in different programming languages.

## Solutions

Here is a breakdown of the tasks and my solutions. Each solution includes a `README.md` file with a more detailed explanation of the problem and my approach.

| **Task J** | C++ | [View Solution](./solutions/task-j/solution.cpp) | [View Problem](./task-questions/Task%20J.pdf) |

## How to Run the Solutions

### C++

To compile and run the C++ solutions, you will need a C++ compiler (like g++).

```bash
# Navigate to the solution directory
cd solutions/task-a

# Compile the solution
g++ -o solution solution.cpp

# Run the solution
./solution
```

### Python

To run the Python solutions, you will need Python 3 installed.

```bash
# Navigate to the solution directory
cd solutions/task-b

# Run the solution
python solution.py
```

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the organizers of Code Gym 2025 for putting on such a great event. This experience was incredibly valuable and has further fueled my passion for coding.
