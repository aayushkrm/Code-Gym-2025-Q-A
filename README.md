# Code Gym 2025 Hackathon: 3rd Place Finish

This repository showcases the solutions I developed as part of team **40+40+1=1001** (a two-person team), which secured a 3rd place finish at the Code Gym 2025 hackathon. This project is a testament to my ability to solve complex problems under pressure and write efficient, correct code in a competitive environment.

## About the Hackathon

The Code Gym 2025 was an intense 24-hour coding competition where participants were challenged with a series of algorithmic problems of varying difficulty. The solutions required a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, and had to be implemented under strict time and memory limitations. My solutions were written in C++ and Python, demonstrating my versatility in different programming languages and problem-solving paradigms.

## Challenges and Approach

The tasks involved a wide range of algorithmic concepts, including:
*   **Graph Theory:** Problems involving graph traversal (BFS) and modeling.
*   **Dynamic Programming:** Counting problems with optimal substructure that required careful state definition and transition logic.
*   **Bit Manipulation:** Tasks that leveraged bitwise operations for high efficiency.
*   **Constructive Algorithms:** Problems that required constructing a valid solution that meets specific constraints, often found through pattern recognition.
*   **Mathematical Reasoning:** Problems involving number theory, probability, and linear algebra concepts.

All solutions were developed under significant time pressure and had to pass a rigorous set of test cases, including hidden ones designed to test for edge cases, performance, and memory usage.

## Solutions

Here is a breakdown of the tasks and my solutions. Each solution includes a detailed explanation of the problem and my approach in its own `README.md` file.

## How to Run the Solutions

### C++

To compile and run the C++ solutions, you will need a C++ compiler (like g++).

```bash
# Navigate to the solution directory, e.g., task-a
cd solutions/task-a

# Compile the solution
g++ -o solution solution.cpp

# Run the solution
./solution
```

### Python

To run the Python solutions, you will need Python 3 installed.

```bash
# Navigate to the solution directory, e.g., task-b
cd solutions/task-b

# Run the solution
python solution.py
```
